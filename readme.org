#+Title: Dockerfiles for generating python packages to use with Glue


* Overview
Including additional python libraries for AWS Glue jobs requires them to be packaged in a certain way and uploaded to S3. Use the dockerfiles in this repository to isolate the installation and packaging of these libraries. These files use the =pg8000= library as an example, but can be modified to use any *pure*[fn:1] python library.

- =Dockerfile= :: Packages libraries into a =.zip= file so that they can be used with AWS Glue PySpark jobs.
- =Dockerfile-egg= :: Packages libraries into a =.egg= file for use with AWS Glue Python shell jobs.


* How to use.

Run the following commands.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Build the docker image.
docker build -t build_pg8000

# Generate the zip file needed.
docker run --rm --name build_pg8000 -v $PWD/zips:/zips build_pg8000

# Copy the file to S3.
aws s3 cp ./zips/pg8000.zip s3://my-glue-libs/
#+END_SRC


[fn:1] AWS Glue only supports pure python libraries. So for example, =pg8000= works, but =psycopg2= does not.
